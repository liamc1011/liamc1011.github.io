Changes I made to the encrypted HTML file made using www.maxlaumeister.com/pagecrypt/

Overhauled HTML structure and CSS (this can be extracted)
In JS section,
line 155: commented it out (so that SUCCESS message doesn't print before unlocking)
line 158: changed function timeout to 50 from 1000 (so almost instant unlocking)
line 160: changed from invalidPassEL.style.display = "block"; to invalidPassEl.style.display = "inline"; (so that the margin and stuff works)
line 161: inserted placeholder.style.display = "none"; (so that when invalidPassEl displays, the placeholder disappears)
line 175: inserted placeholder.style.display = "block"; (so that when invalidPassEl disappears, the placeholder shows up again)
